# Brawloons

The final requirement for our CMSC 137 laboratory class

# Guidelines

```
1. Clone the repository
2. Copy the modified files into the cloned repository (replace the old files if needed)
3. Test the cloned repository with your changes. Make sure it is fully working(!!!)
4. Re-test for the second time
```

# Conventions

```
1. Use an appropriate commit message. A brief summary/description of the changes you have done will do.
2. Properly separate the files, classes go into the bin folder while source codes go into the src folder.
```

# Pushing

```
  $ git add .
  $ git commit -m "<appropriate description of the changes>"
  $ git push origin master
```

$$ Go Beyond, Plus Ultra!
